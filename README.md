 # CodeStrup

## Objective:
    
1. Develop a web application aiming to help users interactively learn about data structures.
2. Use various data structures in application
3. Over the course of the project we will
    1. Integrate code editor with application
    2. Add content for each data structure
    3. Add challenges for user
    4. Use SQL queries to compare points of users

Beginners familiar with basic C++ syntax 

## Languages covered:

C++

## Overview:

* The application will guide users about data structures in C++.
* We plan to include basic data structures like Arrays, Queues, Strings and Stacks.
* It will have code editor integrated within the application which will allow users to test their code as they learn.
* The application will also have some quizzes and the users will be ranked according to their score.
* Admins will be able to add and edit quizzes and access the data of all the users.

## Literature review:
